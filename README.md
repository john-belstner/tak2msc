# tak2msc - Integrating TAK with the MSC Software Suite
(C)2024-2025 John Belstner          General Public License v2

The goal of this project is to integrate the Tactical Awareness Kit (TAK) program with the Military Standard Communications (MSC) software suite for the purpose of transmitting Cursor-On-Target (CoT) messages over-the-air.

The project is divided into three phases.  Phase I & II focuses on rapid-prototyping using Python to establish a robust workflow. Phase III will focus on a production quality application using C/C++ that will seamlessly integrate into the MSC Suite of applications.
- Phase I - Use Python to capture the CoT event records generated by TAK and save them to an XL file.
- Phase II - Use Python to transfer the CoT XML record to one of the MSC Suite of applications.
- Phase III - Create a Windows GUI application that seamlessly integrates the Phase I & II functionalities.
